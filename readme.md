# My Portfolio Site


I have created a portfolio site to showcase my hobbies and skills in which there are different sections which are following :-
1. Home
2. Hobbies
3. Skills
4. About me  


This project is made with pure HMTL, CSS and Javascript without using any of the framework or libraries. To achieve this, I implemented the following :- 



## HTML Sections and Containers
I used Section tags to create different part of this site and also make Containers using div tag to store different components of this site. 



## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. Also used some animation using CSS like poping of icons and flow in skill bars.The site is not fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to navigate through different sections with the help of navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.
